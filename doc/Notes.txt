FileSystems
-----------
Maximum fat32 label length: 11
Works better if padded/truncated.

Maximum ext2 label length: 16

ext2 fs (extlinux) may seem more natural for linux systems, as is NTFS (bootmgr) for Windows, *but*
 1. at least for ubuntu, persistence file is only searched on vfat fs
 2. automatic (U)EFI boot uses FAT32 fs
*However* rEFInd is able to boot ext2 and NTFS EFI bootloaders


Syslinux
--------
syslinux 6.02 and 6.03-preX do not seem to be compatible:
 - 6.02 cannot load 6.03 modules: error message floods the screen
 - 6.03 cannot load 6.02 modules: nothing happens


Windows
-------
Windows 7/8/10 only accesses the first partition (whatever its type) for removable USB disks, so either
 - the install files must be on this partition
 - a virtual drive has to be set
 - partition table must be altered (e.g. from a LiveCD) to have the wanted partition as first


GParted Live
------------
Uses syslinux:
 - 4.x in versions prior to 0.16.2
 - 5.x since version 0.16.2
 - 6.x since version 0.16.2-11
   * 6.02 at first, and 6.03-preX in recent versions

EFI booting does not work: ends in grub bash, and root seems to be Ubuntu.


SystemRescueCD
--------------
Recent versions (since 4.0.x ?) may not work correctly for some graphic cards in graphic (startx) mode.
See:
 - http://www.sysresccd.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=5266
 - http://www.sysresccd.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=5276
Booting with the alternate kernel, or using wizard instead of startx may help.


Ubuntu
------
Uses syslinux:
 - 4.x prior to 14.10
 - 6.03 since 14.10
EFI boot may show an error message:
Could not open "\EFI\BOOT\fallback.efi"

And then either do nothing, or show a text menu to either 'test' or 'install' Ubuntu.
See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1241824
To prevent the error message, which is not an issue if the text menu appears right after, one could copy 'grubx64.efi' to 'fallback.efi'


Fedora
------
Uses syslinux:
 - 4.x prior to 21
 - 6.03 since 21


CentOS
------
6.x: Boot does not end if there is LUKS partition visible: CentOS boot asks for the password, but nothing happens.


Arch Linux
----------
Uses syslinux:
 - 6.02 in versions <= 2014
 - 6.03 in latest versions


Kali
----
Seems to search and find the Ubuntu partition as the one to boot ...
